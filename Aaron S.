00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
put me in front of some really good contacts and I got a lot of offers.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.640
When Ian rolled through, I got a lot of offers and it was really hard to choose

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.400
who I was going to go with. Most of those offers came from the FTD referrals

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.800
that I got.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.600
My files have been spot on with all these reviewers. They're all telling me,

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.200
"We love your work. Good job. Really awesome work."

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.960
Every time they do that, I'm like, "Thanks, Matt."

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.440
Especially if you're newer in the industry, I would definitely recommend it.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.720
But even if you're more experienced and you're just trying to make a switch,

10
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.800
kind of like I did, or find more opportunities with other carriers that you

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800
haven't worked with before,

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.840
other firms you haven't worked with before, I definitely recommend that

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.290
because it gives you connections that you didn't have before because you're

14
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.240
kind of a connected guy.

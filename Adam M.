00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I have a high school friend who's been adjusting for like 12, 13 years, maybe

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.520
even more.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.720
It was kind of like my go-to source at first.

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.960
You know, I got my state licenses, got an Xactimate level one, did all that.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.560
He would put me in touch with some of the firms he worked for.

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.640
But they of course were like, well, that's all your experiences.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.720
you did a little bit of xactimate studying and your licensees.

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.320
I kind of started to hit a wall.

9
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.360
I forget which firm, maybe a Alacrity

10
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.700
I mentioned something like, oh, do you have any other training or certification

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.800
like from

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.680
adjuster TV, and my ears kind of perked up

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.080
I've been eyeballing it for a while and kind of just saving money until the

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.040
time was right

15
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.200
to pull the trigger.

16
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.860
My friend sent like sample claims just to be like, here's what it looks like

17
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.600
and everything.

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.480
But I really needed to like sit with someone from like when you get the loss

19
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.200
report to

20
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.850
scheduling the plane, going there, writing the estimate to just really understand

21
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.560
everything

22
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.760
on like a step by step level that helped a lot.

23
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.640
I've been talking with Sedgwick, Pilot, Alacrity, Pacesetter

24
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.720
I'm going to screw up the name.

25
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.920
Is it the Best claims?

26
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.170
I think those are the main ones I've been like, you know, talking on the phone

27
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.840
and everything.

28
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.000
I probably didn't like fully appreciate that when I first signed up for it.

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.510
But it's also just like in an insanely vast resource to refer to when you

30
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.480
actually are

31
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.160
working with things like it continues being useful after that.

32
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.320
Seeing like, as I did each claim, how much faster

33
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.210
I was getting at it because the first one took like so long and I was like, oh

34
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.960
my God.

35
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.420
It's just really nice to give you an idea of like what it is you're actually

36
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.920
doing, you

37
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.600
know, look like granular level

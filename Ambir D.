00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
You don't find a lot of information even when you're deployed about how to

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.200
actually run claims and make the actual claims themselves.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.760
Having the reference go out to the videos is priceless because a lot of people

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.000
don't have time to sit there with you.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.070
Just get through it yourself, it's sink or swim and because of this course I was

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.800
able to swim.

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.300
That would definitely recommend to anyone trying to get into the industry.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.480
Newer adjusters, even people that had a deployment or two, it's real helpful

9
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.100
for everyone.

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.700
It's going to save you so much time and so many headaches.

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.700
You also get a connection directly with the firms.

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.970
Most people don't realize that when you apply for these firms you're just kind

13
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.900
of like a resume.

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.740
There could be hundreds, depending on the size of the firm, up to thousands of

15
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.530
people that are applying for the same positions and trying to get their foot in

16
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.900
the door.

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.820
So the connections themselves on top of the training combined is a win-win

18
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.500
situation because of those able to get my first deployment.

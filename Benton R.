00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
It's definitely worth it. I looked at some other trainings, but it's I just

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.320
like that it was it's online

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.370
Which is nice. I mean there's some things in person that are great, but

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.920
we have that bank of videos

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.920
So if you are on deployment you get stuck and it's 1:00 AM you can go hold on

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.010
Let me look at this video and it's always something silly like oh, that was it.

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.400
That's what keeping me up for three hours

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.400
so

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.160
just pay for training. It's a good investment. you have to look at it this way

10
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.760
if you go on deployment and

11
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.320
You pay attention to everything that you taught you're gonna make it up

12
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.280
In a day or two really once you get once you get going

13
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.800
So why not and you might be able to stay on deployment stay working

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.220
Versus just showing up and trying to figure it out and all of a sudden you get

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.000
the call that we don't need you anymore

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.670
You took a lot of the mystery out of it. I could be called out tomorrow and I

17
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.880
feel

18
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.760
really comfortable that I could go close claims and

19
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.260
The carriers would be very happy with them if you go to school

20
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.480
That's five ten whatever days you've got to pay for flights or drive time gas

21
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.920
food lodging and

22
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.440
I got to sit on my porch and learn

23
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.240
So yeah, it's no, I loved it

24
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.840

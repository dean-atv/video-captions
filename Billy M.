00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
I've got probably close to a thousand inspections, you know, doing ladder assist

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.840
stuff,

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.880
but just putting together the estimates the right way and just being efficient

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.200
really.

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.720
I jumped into the program because of your contacts and make sure I get things

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.520
done the right way.

7
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.240
It's a whole different animal having to do the entire claim process.

8
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.200
My favorite part was the test at the end really, you know, go through

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.760
everything,

10
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.250
send in what you think is correct, and then having it kicked back with some

11
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.200
feedback on that.

12
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.520
A little bit of a real world feel for what it's like.

13
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.760
If I would have seen, you know, everything from the course on what to do when

14
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.960
you get to a deployment,

15
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680
how to act, how to, you know, what questions to ask.

16
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.320
A thousand percent, I've already actually told some contractors.

17
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.180
I was a contractor before said, yeah, I'm also an adjuster known license in 10

18
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.560
states.

19
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.720
Like, oh, really? I've been thinking about, I was looking at that.

20
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.920
You know, I'm like, well, look, I said, just go here and go to adjuster TV.

21
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.280
Took this course, I got certified, sent to the top of list with a lot of firms,

22
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.560
and you'll learn everything you need to learn.

23
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.880
I'd much rather do the entire claim process and make like three or four times

24
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.440
as much as I make.

25
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.400
I'm making right now.

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.840
First, a few days of a storm will pay for it.

27
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.440
And everything that's included, I'd have probably paid more, honestly.

28
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.680
That was one reason too. I got it. I'm like, I better quit screwing around.

29
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.960
He's going to jack this up to, you know, another couple of grand this year,

30
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.760
and I'm going to be like, oh, shoot, I should have done this in March.

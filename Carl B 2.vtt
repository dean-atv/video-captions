00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
You know, I was in the industry
before I decided to just get

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.010
relicensed up, give it another whirl.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.250
Even though everybody was telling
me it's a horrible time, I was

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.050
lucky to get deployed to a barrel.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.960
And then most recently, the
Helene deal, I had prepared with

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.610
everything through this class.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.970
I went down to even buying the
same camera that you recommended

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.810
and just, I mean, it was just to
the t It was a great deployment.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.270
Kept me on, you know, quite a long time.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.170
You know, at the end there wasn't,
wasn't many of us left, so my files

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.670
and barrel were not that great.

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:33.975
You know, I, I realize that now
photos were probably lacking big time.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:37.515
Uh, after taking Fast Track,
everything really improved.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:41.355
What your program did for me was
really made me a lot more efficient

00:00:41.504 --> 00:00:45.855
and my files a lot more enjoyable for
other people that were reviewing them.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:49.525
I. I know now after taking these other
people's files and having to get 'em

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:53.695
closed and, and reconcile estimates,
and I know why you won't get invited

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:57.685
back to a storm if you're, if all
that stuff's not not good, you know,

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:02.845
and my whole goal going into this
deployment was to be noticed and to.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.860
To get somebody's attention.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.960
Kept asking my trainer, where do I stand?

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.850
Who else is closing some claims?

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.210
You know?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.509
And they, and they, and they just said,
you need to stop worrying about it.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.970
You're, you're in no
danger for a new adjuster.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.830
They may not know the why at the time,
but if, if they really study your program

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.020
and take that stuff to heart and use it
and, and literally follow it, just do

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.539
it without knowing why you're doing it.

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.125
And, and you'll know later on.

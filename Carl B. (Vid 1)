00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
I actually got into adjusting in 2014.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.840
Then I just recently went back and got my Texas license.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.480
It's been a slog since about mid-June for me.

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.840
I'd had some years of experience,

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.640
but it really didn't set me up to be an adjuster at all.

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.720
I did have an earlier deployment with Beryl.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.720
I was lost.

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.880
The level of detail that you went into,

9
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.240
it just really filled in the gaps for me.

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.280
Sedgwick, they reached out, who else?

11
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.600
The best.

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.680
Of course, alacrity.

13
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.840
Pilots reached out.

14
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.160
Quite a few of them have reached out.

15
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.200
And the ones that I'd already had was on the roster

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.920
and had some communication, they called

17
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.640
and went a little deeper with me.

18
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.240
So I could tell this, the recommendation from Matt

19
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.400
has gotten more attention.

20
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.880
Oh, I would 100% recommend, of course.

21
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.720
I was lucky that I had, you know,

22
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.120
I did have some background

23
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.280
and I understood the claims process,

24
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.480
but for a brand new adjuster, it would be money well spent.

25
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.560
Your course would really set somebody up great, you know?

26
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.800
It'd be the closest thing to actually going out

27
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.960
and having a deployment.

28
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.520
You know, you'd get them on the right track, for sure.

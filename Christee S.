00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
Some people are willing to just jump into a storm.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.940
I'm not that kind of person.

3
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.500
I need as much information as possible ahead of time.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.100
You know, if there's someone who's apprehensive,

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.420
they're committed, but they don't feel like information

6
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.020
that they're getting online is solidifying anything.

7
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.420
Like your program is kind of a full picture

8
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.220
of start to finish, which I think is really important.

9
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.220
I've heard from Alacrity, Sedgwick, and Crawford.

10
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.660
I'm glad I have that base experience.

11
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.060
and getting someone to take a chance on me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
One of my former cadets told me about her job

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.560
and how she did a remote.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.240
She made about three times what I did.

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.740
So I'm like, what?

5
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.240
So it piqued my interest.

6
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.760
And so I started doing research

7
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.520
and then I started watching the Adjuster TV.

8
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.800
Found out about the course.

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.200
And I said, man, I'm jumping on this.

10
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.960
The material teaches you from the ground up

11
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.640
on if you're a new adjuster,

12
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.640
you don't know anything about it.

13
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.160
The tips and the tools that you acquire from the course

14
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.920
puts you on the right foot

15
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.920
when you have to get out there on your own.

16
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.640
On a deployment, you're not going to drown

17
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.800
when you're out there.

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.680
You have so much experience that's your way up here,

19
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.880
but you are able to bring it down to a layman's term

20
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.000
and be able to get them up to this level.

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.960
You said that you were gonna recommend us

22
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.800
to different companies.

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.200
And I thought, okay, I'm hoping that he does,

24
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.040
or it might just be that it's a slight push,

25
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.280
but no, it was crazy.

26
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.240
I mean, they actually reached out to me.

27
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.880
So I was really impressed that it was that level of a push.

28
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.960
So thank you.

29
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.360
I would definitely recommend this.

30
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.560
It gives you a tremendous amount of knowledge

31
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.360
about the career field

32
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.680
and about what it takes to be an adjuster.

33
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.000
You won't regret it.

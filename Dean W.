00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
I got an email from you saying pass and you'd get the name out there and since

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.180
then I've gotten calls from several of the firms that impressed my wife quite a

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.000
bit actually.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.240
She's like are you done spending money trying to get yourself out there? Can't

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.000
you go to work now?

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.330
Just the knowledge that you've had over the years that you share with us, all

7
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.260
your scenarios that you send to us so we can see and touch that's certainly a

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.000
huge value as opposed to trying to learn that when you're out in the field.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.200
I can't imagine getting my license and just taking a deployment and trying to go

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
out and figure it out.

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.350
How many other places can you spend X amount of dollars and get the education

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.000
in a week that you need and go out and go to work?

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.810
This is what caught my eye to your program originally is having the connections

14
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.000
with the firms that you have.

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.630
I'd already done some training but I needed refreshing the estimating side of

16
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.000
things you dove into quite a bit farther.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm ready to go now. Just do it.

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.210
Ultimately the money in the grand scheme of things, let's face it, a week of

19
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.000
deployment.

20
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You're paying off your training. I think it's too valuable not to do it.

21
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.570
I feel 100% more comfortable taking a deployment now than I would have a few

22
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.000
weeks ago before we did this training.

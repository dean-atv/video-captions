00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
The hardest part of this whole process is getting experience without experience

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.000
enough

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.640
to get your first opportunity.

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.400
You guys are doing kind of everything to set that up.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.970
The practice claims, takes you through the full thing, contact the customer,

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.440
scope of

7
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.440
property.

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.200
You're writing an actual estimate the way it would be.

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.680
You're getting the feedback like it would.

10
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.160
So it felt like as good a practice as you could get it.

11
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.440
You can piece together some of that stuff, but this is the full process.

12
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.440
I would sit there and come up with questions as it went on.

13
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.040
Those would be answered throughout.

14
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.880
So I really didn't find myself lacking.

15
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.040
You guys were responsive.

16
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.040
The clinics are awesome.

17
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.400
I mean, I've been going through the old clinics now.

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
There's just a ton of information on there.

19
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Hugely valuable.

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.040
There's the partner firms.

21
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.880
I mean, I three reached out immediately.

22
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.080
I feel like I'm getting set up.

23
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.280
I feel like I'm doing kind of all the right things.

24
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.200
I for sure will be going back to this as resources.

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.400
That alone, I think, the value of this is huge.

26
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.040
If it gets you to your first opportunity, that's worth it.

27
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.260
And then if you can come back and use this as kind of the starting point of

28
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.800
your resource,

29
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.880
it's totally worth it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
The resources that you instantly made available to everybody,

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.760
it just made me feel very confident how to be effective at your job,

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.000
streamline process you want to take day to day.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.960
You know, I think that's what I took away the most from it.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.290
It's just having a process for how you're going to handle the work when it

6
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.600
comes.

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.720
But also how to self review ourselves.

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.880
Every carrier is different.

9
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.760
Every firm is different.

10
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.360
the Process you've given us allows us to be effective at anywhere we work at.

11
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.280
I was able to do this all remotely.

12
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.680
And at the same time, it was, it was very detailed, very easy.

13
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.440
If I ever want to go look back and answer years into my career,

14
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.720
I know I can come back to the resources that you've provided.

15
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.480
If you want to get started in this industry, so be a great program.

16
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480
And there's such a multitude of information out there.

17
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.440
It can vary in quality and personal experience now,

18
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.240
When it comes to the top quality and the way this program works,

19
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.440
it has it, you know, compared to other programs.

20
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.400
It's going to more than pay itself, you know, several times over.

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.840
I really believe that the value of this program is way more than worth it.

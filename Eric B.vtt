00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
I went into your class and I got about halfway through

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.520
and then I got sucked up into the field,

3
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.560
I got started and I never slowed down.

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.320
Buffalo got hit by a major storm,

5
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.520
it was all frozen pipes, snow crushing roofs,

6
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.120
things like that, that's how I got started.

7
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.640
Apparently I did such a good job

8
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.320
that they kept feeding me stuff.

9
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.360
I'm probably approaching 3,000 claims.

10
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.960
My quality of work is there, my understanding of the program,

11
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.440
That time management piece that you put in all your courses

12
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.560
is so critical.

13
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.960
The biggest thing that I really discovered in this field

14
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.000
was you're just dumped into it, right?

15
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And then it's kind of like learning how to build the airplane

16
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.120
as the airplane's flying.

17
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.760
You're given 40 claims dropped into your lap

18
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.960
and that is your responsibility and your life

19
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.240
until you get those 40 done

20
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.040
and then you end up getting more and more.

21
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.600
You're agreeing to take care of those people

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.640
that are sitting in front of you.

23
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.800
Your cycle time is very important, right?

24
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.920
The worst thing that will get you into trouble

25
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.160
is if you're scheduling and then taking forever

26
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.360
to get that piece in so you're not closing claims, right?

27
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080
Follow Matt's schedule, you'll ramp up pretty quickly

28
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.560
once you start to see, okay,

29
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.360
there's repetition and everything that we do.

30
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.840
But it's just getting your foot in the door to begin with.

31
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.120
You really need something, some sort of a course

32
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.920
that is connected to not necessarily a carrier,

33
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.720
but to [an IA Firm] like Allcat or Sedgwick

34
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.920
or someone like that,

35
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.120
because that's the only way you're really gonna get noticed.

36
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.560
Because then [The firms] know that you've done some training,

37
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.800
you put some time in and getting some understanding

38
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.640
of what the job is.

39
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.560
Seems to be the only way to really kind of get in on this field.

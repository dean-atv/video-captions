00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm a dance instructor. I'm a ballroom dancer. You get into a lot of different

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.140
conversations with your students, right?

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.940
I came across one of my students and he owns an I.A. firm.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.650
I never heard ever about an insurance adjuster. Right away your videos

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.240
came across.

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.560
I realized that you had a good platform for people that are, you know, it suits

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.680
everybody, right?

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.330
Like if you have experience, you can get new techniques, new systems in

9
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.080
different ways.

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.190
If you're new, you understand, all right, well, this is what I have to do. You

11
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.360
explain everything step by step,

12
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.660
how you help  set yourself for success before you even go out

13
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.240
there.

14
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.580
As a new adjuster, I wouldn't want to submit a file that they're gonna

15
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.360
laugh at.

16
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.850
It's not easy, but if you understand that you follow the systems, which I want

17
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.880
to say that the systems that you have added into the Fast Track To

18
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.520
Deployment

19
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.880
are amazing. I mean, you can definitely get things done. Time is money, right?

20
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.640
Or, you know, income for us.

21
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.390
And as long as you're able to process claims the proper way, you will be able

22
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.480
to receive more claims or build a great reputation

23
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.960
that you will in the future have better opportunities. I am already on call

24
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.360
with a Pacesetter and other two companies

25
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.150
that contacted me through Fast Track To Deployment. 100%. not only

26
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.240
the monetary value, right?

27
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.860
The information that the program offers is just priceless at this point. A very

28
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.280
, very good tool to have for the future.

29
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.400
I mean, like, if you get a question like, for example, I have no background in

30
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.960
construction, but, you know, after watching,

31
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.400
I understand what kind of materials going to a, you know, drywall repair or if

32
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.120
there's a flood or roof replacements.

33
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.620
100% worth it. Definitely don't rush through it. Allocate the right amount of time

34
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.440
into it and you will see how worth it it is.

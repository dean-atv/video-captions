00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
It was a lot more of a difficult transition than I thought it would be.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.080
You talk to the guys in the field and they're like, yeah, you get your

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.400
license, you get on boarded at a couple of firms.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.480
And next thing you know, you're making well into the six figures.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.840
And as we both know, that's not quite how it goes.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.370
I was trying to get work and I was trying to get as many certifications as I

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.800
can.

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.440
Got my state farm certification.

9
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.480
And within 15 minutes, I was on the phone with alacrity being deployed on

10
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.560
Helene, I'm going to have to be running claims at a high level next week.

11
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.800
I don't know that I'm quite prepared for this.

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.160
So I got Fast Track in that couple of days I was packing my bags, watching all

13
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.640
the videos on repeat, understanding the claims process down there.

14
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.040
I used it as a tool consistently, you know, I mean, on a daily basis, like,

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.200
well,

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.080
we got a big tree fall claim today.

17
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.080
We're watching the tree fall video again.

18
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.400
Uh, I mean, it was really helpful down there.

19
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.920
Pretty much everybody was brand news.

20
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.400
We have a couple hundred people trying to get help from five trainers.

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.920
They do the best that they can, but being able to go in there, find exactly

22
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.680
what it is I'm looking for some kind of guide almost to, you know, hold my hand

23
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.360
through that, that process.

24
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.600
It'll be a reference that I'm sure I'll use for a long time.

25
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.360
All the Xactimate prep and everything else in there that's not even Fast Track

26
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.200
itself.

27
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.560
There's a lot more information on there than I thought there would be.

28
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.120
It's very well rounded at me more than prepared.

29
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.000
Some of the firms that I've applied to and they say, you don't have enough

30
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.560
experience to be on your roster.

31
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.360
Now they're emailing me, Hey, we'd like you to join our roster.

32
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.880
And I got the certification a couple of days ago.

33
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.520
I think I've had four or five firms reach out to me so far.

34
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
Even got a call from Pilot yesterday.

35
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.400
I definitely think it was worth it.

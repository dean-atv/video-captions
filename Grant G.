00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
My main thing was like, okay, once we do the scoping, how do we file the claim?

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.840
You know, what does that process look like within xactimate start to finish?

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.560
Kind of hard to find resources on that.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.880
But obviously that was answered quite well within the program.

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.160
It's basically just like an encyclopedia for being an independent claims

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.720
adjuster

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.520
The xactimate certifications, the xactimate demo version, that in and of itself would

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.600
almost be worth the price of admission, right?

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.280
But then you go through and you get to kind of learn the whole process.

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.160
Those claim scenarios, what gear do you need to have and the macros,

11
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.120
templates and everything, like all of that was just super surprising to me

12
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.160
that for what I paid, I'm receiving all that value.

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.240
Sedgwick, The Best claims and Pacesetter all reached out to me.

14
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.240
Same day, same day as my completion.

15
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.720
I don't know what else you could even include in this program, to be honest

16
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.960
with you.

17
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.760
I really gosh, there's so much already in there.

18
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.920
I can't even imagine what else you could add.

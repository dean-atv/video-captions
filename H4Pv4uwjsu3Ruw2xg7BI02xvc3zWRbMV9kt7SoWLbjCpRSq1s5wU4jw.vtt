00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
took this course, I got certified, sent to the top of list with a lot of firms

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:03.840
and you'll learn

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.600
everything you need to learn. Few days of a storm will pay for it. And

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.640
everything that's included,

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.400
I'd have probably paid more, honestly. How many other places can you spend x

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.360
amount of dollars,

7
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.850
get the education in a week that you need and go out and go to work? The week

8
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.520
of deployment,

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.800
you're paying off your training, right? I think it's too valuable not to do it.

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.920
That's first when I saw the price tag. It's like that's just too much money.

11
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.240
Honestly,

12
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.610
if I had paid twice that, it probably still would have been worth it. I would

13
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.960
absolutely recommend it.

14
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.240
I'm really glad I did because it's paid off and it paid off quick too. Pretty

15
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.120
much right after I

16
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.900
finished up with your course I got deployed. It's going to save you so much

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.760
time and so many

18
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.700
headaches. The connections themselves on top of the training combined is a win-

19
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.720
Win situation because

20
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.550
of that I was able to get my first deployment. It's definitely worth it. If you

21
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.240
go on deployment,

22
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.700
you pay attention to everything that you taught, you're going to make it up in

23
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.640
a day or two and

24
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.230
you might be able to stay on deployment and stay working versus just showing up

25
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.120
, trying to figure

26
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.370
it out. Then all of a sudden you get the call that we don't need you anymore.

27
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.600
So just pay for training.

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.360
When I saw the program last year, I hesitated and I wish I did not. Did you get

29
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
what you paid for?

30
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.860
Now I can really show up and start closing claims within the first week as a

31
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.560
new adjuster.

32
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.720
Everything that I could ever want to know is searchable in your database. The

33
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.760
resources you get for that

34
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.400
money is incredible. It's no BS. It's all relevant as far as value. You might

35
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.360
you might undervalue that.

36
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.350
I had an email from Sedgwick and an hour after that, a phone call from 

37
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.480
Alarity. Neither one of

38
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.540
those companies was just jumping at the door. But the second you send

39
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.440
your thing and 

40
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.690
boom, now they're interested. That would have been worth three times what we

41
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.040
paid.

42
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.220
This is a great value and probably truth be not on a little bit under price. Do

43
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.880
your background,

44
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.330
see who the people are that you're looking into for spending this kind of money

45
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.960
for training

46
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.840
and see what kind of value they've already offered the industry.

47
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.840
Worth way more than what it costs. It's what you're going to do and see

48
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.680
when you go out there in the real world. Without the knowledge that I gained,

49
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.360
I would have failed immediately. Probably had a very short career.

50
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.840
I can see why people would be a little shocked at how much it costs. But the

51
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.200
amount of stuff you get,

52
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.120
you're not going to get that anywhere else. I probably would have paid more. I

53
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.320
mean,

54
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.080
if you go work for a career, they're going to invest themselves into you. But

55
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.520
if you're going to be

56
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.080
an independent, you have to invest in yourself. I can't imagine doing this

57
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080
without a course like

58
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.630
yours. Content to the course probably justifies a little higher price. What I

59
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.760
got from it really

60
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.850
is invaluable to know that I have the knowledge to make the course double

61
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.160
triple quadruple with

62
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.280
word and that happens in one month. Yeah, definitely worth it. Definitely.

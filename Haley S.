00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
I was one of the early ones that jump in, I think.

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.930
If I had not, I think it had been pretty rough, the understanding

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.480
of the flow,

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.640
even if you have no experience at all, you're going to learn

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.400
basically everything from start to finish out of the claim.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.440
And then it's just a matter.

7
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.220
Learning to repeat that.

8
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.120
For me, it's perfect.

9
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.600
I can work on it early in the morning.

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.840
I come home in the afternoons.

11
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.640
The knowledge was great.

12
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.960
I mean, I've already gone back and looked at some of the things again.

13
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.480
That's half the point.

14
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.720
It's got the, you've got access to it.

15
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.040
I sent my final thing to you guys about six, 20 in the morning, my time.

16
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.080
And by eight in the morning, I'd already had an email from Sedgwick.

17
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.360
And an hour after that, a phone call from Alacrity, neither one of those two

18
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.600
companies was like just jumping at the door to talk to me at NACA or since, but

19
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.760
the second, you know, you see your thing out, you know, lo and behold, boom.

20
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.560
Now they're interested.

21
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.240
That's the hope and worth three times what we paid.

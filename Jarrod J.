00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I just met a guy on my neighbor's roof.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.680
He was down in Georgia for that big storm.

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.720
I don't know if this is accurate.

4
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.240
I don't know if these guys are bs-ing me or not,

5
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.400
but he made almost $200K while he was down there.

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.440
There was a guy who came to my house.

7
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.320
He was a pastor for 20 years, and now he's becoming a adjuster.

8
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.600
And he's like, "I love my job."

9
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.440
And his first year, he's made $175K.

10
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.480
He went to one hail storm out in Colorado,

11
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.720
made another $45,000, and like, I think he said 14 days.

12
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.840
I really don't know how he's done it.

13
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.160
It just seems so overwhelming.

14
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.800
How to do it, who to talk to.

15
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800
I didn't even know where to begin.

16
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.880
I got a lot riding on.

17
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.120
I got a family of five.

18
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.240
And I got to support him. So, I am not going to get kicked off a storm.

19
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.400
Then I found your videos and was like, "Oh, okay."

20
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.080
If this guy's teaching, I'm all in.

21
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.200
The process is the schedule, the paper system, all of that.

22
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.080
All your partners.

23
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.800
Sedgwick has contacted me, the best company, a couple others.

24
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.040
Like, I'm so happy that I found this course.

25
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.520
Even happier that I didn't get deployed in October.

26
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.200
Because if I just jumped right into it,

27
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.680
I would have been in like a puddle of tears in my hotel room,

28
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.280
crying to my wife that I want to come home.

29
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.520
Like, I don't know how anyone would do it without your course.

30
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.120
100%. Best money I've spent.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
Before Fast Track to deployment, I was just on Google getting sucked down a

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.440
rabbit hole.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.200
I thought I had a pretty good understanding of what went into adjusting, but

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.720
there was

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.920
a lot I didn't know.

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.240
Just the little things, I would have been getting returned, you know, they

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.880
would have returned

8
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.440
my file a hundred times.

9
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.320
Oh, it would be a disaster.

10
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.310
Once I got to your course, everything that I could ever want to know is search

11
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.960
able in

12
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.960
your database.

13
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960
It's insane.

14
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.320
The resources you get for that money is incredible.

15
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.320
It's no BS.

16
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.320
It's all relevant.

17
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.320
No.

18
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560
As far as value, you might have undervalued it.

19
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.400
I've been on boarded with Sedgwick and Alacrity.

20
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.000
I went to the orientation with Andrew Price.

21
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.400
He mentioned you several times when people would ask about training.

22
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.920
He certainly thinks highly of you.

23
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.820
You can tell the Best claims people called me as well.

24
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.640
The first couple of days, my phone felt like I was ringing off the hook.

25
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.120
I think it was a great investment.

26
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.100
I would no doubt recommend it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
I already got a call from a lady saying that she'd received your recommendation

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.000
from me from FTD.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Pacesetter, right?

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.490
And Pacesetter is one of the ones that I had set up and applied to before and

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.000
just never heard anything from.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's like, you fill everything out and then it's just a big nothing, right?

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.430
But I think it was like the day after I got my results, she called me. We had a good

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.000
30-minute conversation.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.400
Now, they've done a background check and I'm on their active roster, so that was

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.000
impressive.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.990
I did hear from TheBest Claims, another one that I had applied and heard

12
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.000
nothing from,

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.810
but the same day that I heard from a Pacesetter, I heard from a recruiter for

14
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.000
them.

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.990
And then just last night, somebody from Hausch & Co. reached out and asked

16
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.000
if I was interested in working for them doing dailies in Alabama.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.220
And I got a claim this morning in my email before their onboarding paperwork

18
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.000
showed up in my email.

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.170
I was researching it for probably three or four months before I signed up for

20
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.000
Fast Track.

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And I knew there was a whole bunch of information that I was missing.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.760
I decided, yeah, if I was going to do this on my own, it was going to take a

23
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.000
significant amount of time.

24
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I needed to go ahead and pay for training.

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.060
It filled in the gaps because you presented a logical step-by-step way

26
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.000
to actually get started and do the job.

27
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.680
It would have taken me a lot longer to gain the knowledge and figure things out

28
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.000
.

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't have any doubts.

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Everything in FTD was absolutely relevant.

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Really appreciate what you do for newbies coming into the industry.

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's been very helpful. Definitely, definitely worth it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
As first when I saw the price tag, I was like,

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.320
that's just too much money.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.000
Honestly, if I had paid twice that,

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.560
it probably still would have been worth it.

5
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.280
I would absolutely recommend it.

6
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.480
I've got people right now that I wanna try to convince them

7
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.200
to become adjusters and the fast track to deployment

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.560
would definitely be something I would be telling them to do.

9
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.320
Especially with Hurricane season coming up,

10
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.720
I hear all those stories about people burning out

11
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.920
in the first week or two.

12
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.120
I'm not worried about that anymore.

13
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.440
I feel like I could go show up to a hurricane

14
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.840
and they could give me 50 claims.

15
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.840
And I'd be fine because of just how organized your system was

16
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.200
and just the step-by-step knowing that if I had to show up

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.400
on a storm tomorrow, I'd know what to expect.

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.200
That's one of the biggest benefits of the program.

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.880
Almost immediately within less than a day,

20
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.880
Crawford, Pacesetter, CCMS, and Sedgwick reached out to me.

21
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.440
When I've been doing the onboarding with them,

22
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.640
they love your training.

23
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.920
Honestly, I love the program.

24
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.600
So I only really have positive things to say about it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
I'm thankful and grateful.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.840
I truly appreciate the way you put the course together.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.070
There's a lot of good points and it all fits together to basically enable

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.080
people to succeed.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.920
Already gotten phone calls, I think, from four of the different firms based on

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.200
your recommendation.

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.960
I didn't even know what a property adjuster was.

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.960
Doing a Google search

9
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.720
As you know, it's limited.

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.360
My biggest question at the beginning was just like, where is even the start

11
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.920
point?

12
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.920
Where is A?

13
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.840
Not to mention how to get to Z, but just where is A?

14
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.600
Obviously, your course fills that void.

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.320
This is how you do this from A to Z.

16
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.840
Not many things in life provide that.

17
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.800
Your course literally answered all my questions.

18
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.840
I probably, to put it in one word, the comprehensiveness of your course.

19
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840
I'll put it this way.

20
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.200
If I fail, it's my own fault.

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.680
So you've given me everything that I need to do it and do it right.

22
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.480
It's so simple, it's so foolproof.

23
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.480
Extremely valuable.

24
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.280
Let me just do what Matt has learned and don't try to reinvent.

25
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.040
You could charge more and people would pay more and still be happy.

26
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.960
It's, again, it is unheard of to really to be an invest such a little amount.

27
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.680
And then your first deployment, make three times that or four times that or

28
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.280
five times

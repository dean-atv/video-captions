00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
I really enjoyed it learning by the videos. All the information is there. I did

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.280
talk to other

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.980
people at NACA that had been through other adjuster schools. They still weren't

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.440
working,

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.270
still weren't getting any claims. They didn't seem like they had any leads

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.440
where I have, I

7
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.080
just got bombarded with after I passed a course with IA Firms to onboard.

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.280
Absolutely do it.

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.150
If you want to be an adjuster, this is a great way to learn, in my opinion,

10
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.840
because you can go

11
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.890
through at your own pace. I don't want to learn it just enough to pass the

12
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.400
course. I want to learn

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.740
it and retain it so that I can use it. If you go to a school, you're sitting

14
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.160
there and whoever's

15
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.460
teaching you is telling you stuff and you're trying to write it down, then you

16
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.080
're missing

17
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.590
other stuff that they're saying after that. Not a way to go back and review the

18
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.280
information,

19
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.520
whereas with your videos, you can just rewind it and watch it again. however

20
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.240
many times it takes

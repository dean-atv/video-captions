00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.310
When I saw the program last year, I hesitated and I wish I did not because the

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.760
time I spent

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.550
going through the deployment and trying to learn on my own, once I took your

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:13.920
program,

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.240
it was like crystal clear. It's not just the learning that I need, but someone

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.760
to validate that I know

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.330
what I'm doing so that firms would be able to trust me with the claims. I

8
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.280
literally completed it on the

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.920
26th, which was Tuesday of last week. And then like the very next day, I

10
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.360
received an email from

11
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.220
Crawford. They are more strict in regards to allowing new adjusters to onboard

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.880
with them.

13
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.750
So that was really, that was really nice just to be able to start at the

14
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.560
onboarding process.

15
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.880
Typically they require an interview. I did not have to do an interview. Not

16
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.240
only do you put our

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.080
names in the front of the companies that are partnered with the program, but

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.080
more so, there's a clear

19
00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.740
blueprint of how to close claims in a systematic way to where there's no

20
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.960
learning curve. A lot

21
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.760
of adjusters will ask, "Should I go to training or should I do this or does

22
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.000
this matter?" Try to

23
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.160
nickel and dime it, kind of like how I was at first. Oh, I'll figure this out

24
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.280
on my own. It's just

25
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.160
you get what you pay for. If you don't put anything into your development, then

26
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.080
when you get out into

27
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.490
the field, there's so many things I learned from the Fast Track to Deployment

28
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.120
program that I'm like,

29
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.930
I would have, I see what you mean by the washout. I would have been just

30
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.200
overwhelmed not knowing

31
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.720
what to do. And now I can literally show up and start closing claims within the

32
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.640
first week as a

33
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.000
new adjuster. I have that confidence now to where you give me 50 claims based

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.920
off of what you taught

35
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.700
me how to do. I can contact those individuals, plan everything out, and start

36
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.920
building up to

37
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.240
the blueprint that you gave. So yeah.

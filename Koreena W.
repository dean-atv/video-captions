00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
I did a class to get my license, but it doesn't really teach you what to do

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.960
after that.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.240
I spent a month trying to figure out, well, what do I do now?

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.360
If I get hired, how do I process a claim?

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.560
Your name kept popping up and it happened to be that you were doing the

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.600
deployment class.

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.360
The money upfront is like, oh, but I have learned so much and it is so

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.280
invaluable to understand why you do the way you do,

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.960
like the photo order and the the diaries.

10
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.480
Once you started talking about how to take, let's say, 35 claims, I would have

11
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.400
absolutely over-scheduled myself thinking,

12
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.930
oh, it can't be that hard. I would have failed. You know, you can go on YouTube

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.760
, you can, you can go anywhere and find the information,

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.420
but is it truly valid? People that are on YouTube making those videos, they don

15
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.520
't have a 30-year reputation out there that have actually done the work.

16
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.530
They're new adjusters, they're super young, or they are, they just didn't know

17
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.760
enough for me to have the confidence to take their word for it.

18
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.560
So you're saying I'm old then? No, I'm not.

19
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.280
You have experience. You have experience.

20
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.680
And there's not a lot of people out there that are talking that do.

21
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.680
I would encourage anybody thinking about it to do it.

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.140
Just on Friday afternoon alone after I got that email from you guys, the final

23
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.640
email, my phone went insane.

24
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.180
The phone, the emails, everything just went crazy. And you feel good when you

25
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.600
're done. You feel educated.

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.740
You didn't learn something that you didn't need to know. You need to know it

27
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.120
all.

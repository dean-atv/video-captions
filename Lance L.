1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
We had already gotten the license.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.720
We knew there was still a lot of stuff that we didn't know,

3
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.240
that we didn't know.

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.120
What drew us to you was the ability

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.880
to learn how to do a claim from A to Z.

6
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.520
Now that I've been through it, I can't imagine going out there

7
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.720
and running a claim for the first time

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.040
without having that training that we got from you.

9
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.800
I would have embarrassed myself terribly.

10
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.560
This class is worth way more than what it costs.

11
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.200
All of this schooling that you take to get your license

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.120
really isn't applicable.

13
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.040
Your class is applicable.

14
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.440
It's what you're going to do and see

15
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.720
when you go out there in the real world and run a call.

16
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.560
Without the knowledge that I gained from that class,

17
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.680
I would have failed immediately

18
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.000
and probably had a very short career.

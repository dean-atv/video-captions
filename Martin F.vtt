00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
talk with Sedgwick, Pacesetter and alacrity as well

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.760
Definitely took somebody with, I mean, no knowledge outside of

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.600
what's taught within the licensure course and put backing

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.560
behind what an adjuster does.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.520
The difference between being productive and being successful,

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.440
you're approaching it from a success standpoint.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.240
And I think that's really the best way to go.

8
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.760
You can't learn, you know, running full speed.

9
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.360
You got to do a crawl walk run.

10
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.600
What do I need to do to set me ahead of everybody else?

11
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.040
That's what brought me to the Adjuster TV course.

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.440
It's not just a course that's trying to get your money saying

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.640
that they're putting you ahead.

14
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.480
The course is actually giving you the knowledge, the pathway,

15
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.160
the advice needed to actually implement.

16
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.600
That's what I got out of it.

17
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.880
Most was all those little things of like, this is the information,

18
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.960
but this is how you're successful at it.

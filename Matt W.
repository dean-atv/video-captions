00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Don't go off with Facebook and Instagram.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.880
People are saying, because 99% of what you'll see on there is all

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.320
negative.

4
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.580
Being on the other side of all this training, I see that those are actually the

5
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.920
people that

6
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.520
have like the least amount of training.

7
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.520
They're just going out there for a quick buck and then they get turned around

8
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.920
because they

9
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.360
don't have their adequate training to make things happen.

10
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.290
As soon as I got my certification, next day I was getting phone calls from

11
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.740
this big

12
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.040
firms that I applied for over a month and a half, two months ago, trying to get

13
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.320
my foot in the door

14
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.600
and the next day I was getting phone calls from them.

15
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.680
The training was great, but the accreditation is going to really pay off

16
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.240
dividends.

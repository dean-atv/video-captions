00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
Your course and your help answered a lot of it for me.

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.280
It showed us what we needed to know and there was no fluff.

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.840
There was no other stuff.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.200
If you're willing to learn something new and don't have any ideas in your own

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.400
head

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.080
that this is the way it needs to be done,

7
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.800
which you have no reason to have any ideas because you don't know what you're

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.080
doing.

9
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.440
So you have to take it from somebody who does know what they're doing.

10
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.520
And what better than to get training from someone like yourself?

11
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.280
You provided the templates, you provided everything you needed to know,

12
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.640
and then a well-owned behold, it's easy.

13
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.560
It's here, it's here, you do this.

14
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.120
Commit to getting education and training from someone who's done the work.

15
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.920
I would have had to gone to one of the facilities and train out of town.

16
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.320
Hotels, travel, food, that kind of thing.

17
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.520
I would have done it, but I didn't have to make that decision

18
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.360
and I was able to do it in a way that worked better for me.

19
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:53.860

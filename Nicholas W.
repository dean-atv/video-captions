00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I was a staff adjuster previously.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was on their CAT team.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.400
I would definitely say to join the program,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.200

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.800
where you just put them on a schedule and put them in the field right after.

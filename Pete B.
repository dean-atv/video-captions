00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Headed on the Kentucky for the recent storms. I've been doing this for a little

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.800
bit less than a year.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.800
For someone who brand new to do what I'm doing, large commercial, large loss

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.110
stuff, total loss stuff, retirement communities where there's 50 to 70

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.800
residential homes.

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.750
I mean, I have hundreds of buildings I've looked at. I followed your method about

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.000
you described how to scope a property.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.400
You said to do a self file review. And that's probably the best thing.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.470
I always think I'm all done. Then I go and generate report and look at it. And

10
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.800
of course, I miss something, which is great.

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
I could go back and make the adjustments before I turn it in.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.670
Being a new person, having the confidence that I got from the Fast Track To

13
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.400
deployment.

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.270
Nobody could tell that I was intimidated or shaking in my boots at the first

15
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.000
few ones.

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.600
The same process is just a lot larger scale.

17
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.700
Somebody who came from outside of construction or contracting, they were

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.000
shocked at how well I did at first.

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.530
And the files that I turned in are very, very good. Very little do I get any

20
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.800
kind of kickbacks.

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.480
I pleasantly surprised at what I learned in your class. It really gave me the

22
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.400
confidence and a leg up to really start to hit the ground running.

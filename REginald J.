The thing that really brought me to your program was your partnerships with the

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.900
IA

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.860
firms. When I finished your course, within three hours, I was contacted by

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.900
pilot and

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.420
within two days I was contacted by six of the firms that had a text two days

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.860
ago to

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.600
be on standby with pilot or the storm that's in the golf.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.230
Yeah, no the value of your course delivered what you promised and that's huge

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.600
because

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.440
I mean obviously the biggest issue for folks is getting a break, that initial

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.100
break.

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.100
I can't imagine doing this without a course like yours. I mean I really can't.

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.300
You would

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.560
have to have had, I would think, on the job experience unless you would just be

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.980
totally

16
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.010
lost and would highly recommend it for the dollars that content of the course

17
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.360
probably

18
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.800
justifies a little higher price. What I got from it really is invaluable.

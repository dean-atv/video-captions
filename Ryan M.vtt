00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
There was a lot of moving parts coming into [adjusting].

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.600
There's a slog, you know, you've kind of got to fight through that stuff.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.840
I can pass a license test, but I still don't know what the hell I'm doing.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.080
I sent the email to you saying "Hey, what should I be working on?"

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.240
I feel like I should be getting the Xactimate level one.

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.160
before I do the fast track and then you kind of straighten me out and said

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.680
do this,

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.680
do this and do this.

9
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.600
And that was very helpful.

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.880
I feel like a much, much better prepared.

11
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.560
I like the video format, right?

12
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.240
if there's something I feel like I already have a good grasp of,

13
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.640
I can speed up and go through it pretty quick.

14
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.860
If there's something I need to dig in a little bit more around, I can back up, watch it

15
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.360
again.

16
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.000
I had two firms reach out.

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.580
As soon as you notified some, I had two reach out to me right away

18
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.760
.

19
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.560
I would recommend it.

20
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.180
I can see how would make me more effective and be able to do more claims in a

21
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.000
day or a week.

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.400
I feel more confident by the day.

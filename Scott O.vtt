00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
It was literally six minutes after I received your email that I got a call from

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.120
Alacrity [Partner Firm]. Definitely go for it if you want to succeed as an adjuster. and it

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.900
will pay itself off.  It works if you work it.

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.860
So it'll definitely be a good return on investment. Fast Track

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.180
gave me the confidence to get out there and start accepting assignments.

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.300
First one I did was a sewer backup in a basement.

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.740
So it was a pretty big, pretty big job and then the next one was a total loss

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.820
fire.

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.910
So I kind of got thrown right in, but using your training videos and the macros

10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.220
, I was

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.580
able to actually successfully get through those.

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.900
It's just knowing the process, filling in a lot of gaps, tips and tricks that

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.500
you wouldn't

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.620
have known without going through your training. I deployed for like a tornado in

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.460
my local area

16
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.420
and had I not gone through your training, I would have washed out

17
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.900
from that

18
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.020
just from the overwhelm. It definitely help me get through that. Even just the

19
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.700
simple things

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.340
of doing recon and scheduling. Absolutely.

21
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.660
Just want to thank you and Dean for all the work you do because, you know, it was

22
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.040
me getting

23
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.700
on AdjusterTV just watching videos on YouTube that got me started here.

24
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.180
So definitely appreciate it.

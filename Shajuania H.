00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
And I have no regrets.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.560
The fast track to deployment course fully equipped me for the field.

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.280
I went out in the field for the first time.

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.720
Hurricane Ian and I crushed it.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.280
I actually sent you a email showing you how good I did out in the field.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.120
So I close over 50 claims my first time in the field.

7
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.800
The fast track to deployment course will do that for you.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.280
Beginning to end, A to Z.

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.000
He shows you everything you need to be successful in the field.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.480
He'll show you how to do your schedule, which is so very important.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.520
That recon, all of that stuff.

12
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.560
Oh, yeah, it gives you insight into what you're going to be presented with, you

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.760
know, when you get to that property.

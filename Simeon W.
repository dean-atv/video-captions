00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
There's so much information going around

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.320
that I was just trying to figure out

3
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.440
how to pursue this career that I was really interested in.

4
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.480
And I saw your YouTube, then saw the Fast Track To Deployment

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.440
deployment.

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.480
I really thought that it was an investment worth

7
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.080
getting into, so I'm really glad I did,

8
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.400
because it's paid off, and it paid off quick, too.

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.480
I mean, it's pretty much right after I finished up

10
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.760
with your course I got deployed.

11
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.040
I went on Hurricane Idalia in Georgia.

12
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.440
The hurricane didn't hit as hard as some people expected,

13
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.800
but I got to stick around to the end.

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.080
We had two cuts of people, they ended up halving our staff,

15
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.040
and then they cut in half again.

16
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.560
But I made it to the end.

17
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.800
They were pleased with the work,

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.160
and of course, I have you to thank for that,

19
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.880
because I would have been completely in the dark otherwise.

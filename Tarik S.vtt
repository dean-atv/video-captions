00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
I've done mock claims before through some other training programs, but I think

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.480
FastTrack has,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.940
it's really like a companion for when I'm out in the field, and I feel

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.800
pretty equipped to

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.470
kind of address whatever comes up. When I go out there, probably after a

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.720
hurricane, I'm going to be

7
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.040
dealing with a lot. I didn't want to bother my field support too much. If I'm

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.120
getting claims,

9
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.130
and I'm like, "Oh, I don't know what this is. I don't know what this is. I don

10
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.840
't know what this is."

11
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.910
You know? Having gone through the Fast Track program feels like I've got most of

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.360
my grounds

13
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.510
covered, especially the videos at the end where you're writing these estimates

14
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.120
for all the

15
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.090
components, like a roof repair, windows, and then creating those macros

16
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.120
. Just having that

17
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.240
framework, I think, is super helpful. When you're staring at a blank page, it's

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.440
much more intimidating

19
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.420
and harder to just get started. Then if you're like, "Okay, I know I'm dealing

20
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.160
with roofs,

21
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.830
so I'm just going to plug this macro in, see what I need, what I don't, and go

22
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.280
from there."

23
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.160
You know? I definitely recommend it. Probably the best training I've received

24
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.960
so far. The training

25
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.070
goes through policy, the diaries that we write, and talking to the insured, the

26
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.600
inspection, the

27
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.050
training just covers everything. When you see the price tag, you're like, "Okay

28
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.200
, this is a commitment."

29
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.380
But then once I started going through it, I was like, "Okay, this basically

30
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.720
covers everything I

31
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.720
wanted to cover and satisfies my expectations.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
I was very skeptical coming into it.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.160
From time to time, you lose money, taking chances on things.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.920
And I was obviously worried about that here.

4
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.320
So far, it's been more than what I had envisioned.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.400
You're probably charging a little bit too little

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.080
for what your value you're adding.

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.560
There's a lot of intangible things around this career

8
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.240
that you have to understand before you go into it

9
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.400
and doing those claims clinics and understanding,

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.360
okay, here's the top scenario is you're gonna see on a deployment.

11
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.120
That's where that's a lot of value.

12
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.320
Once those adjusting firms start sending you the emails

13
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.840
that say, hey, matt from adjuster TV sent us your name,

14
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.360
you know, we'd like you to get on board it.

15
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.560
That's a nice feeling when people are reaching out to you.

16
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.880
I would say absolutely do it.

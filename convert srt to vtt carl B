1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
I was in the industry before.

2
00:01:06,577 --> 00:00:06,053
I decided to just get relicensed up give it another whirl, even though everybody was

3
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:12,669
telling me it's a horrible time was lucky to get deployed to Beryl most recently the
Helene deal.

4
00:01:28,066 --> 00:00:15,103
I'd prepared with everything through this class.

5
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:17,934
I went down to even buying the same camera that you recommended.

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,229
And just, mean, it was just to the T

7
00:01:43,884 --> 00:00:22,491
was a great deployment.

8
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:24,329
kept me on, you know, quite a long time.

9
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,442
know, at the end there wasn't many of us left, so.

10
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,904
my files on Beryl were not that great.

11
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,165
You know, I realize that now.

12
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:34,235
Photos were probably lacking big time.

13
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:37,561
after taking Fast Track, everything really improved.

14
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:46,381
what your program did for me was really made me a lot more efficient and my files a lot
more enjoyable for other people that were reviewing them.

15
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:52,849
know now after taking these other people's files and having to get them closed and
reconciled estimates and.

16
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:58,238
I know why you won't get invited back to a storm if you're if all that stuff's not it's
not good, you know

17
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:04,898
And my whole goal going into this deployment, was noticed and to get somebody's attention,

18
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,092
kept asking my trainer, where do I stand?

19
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:12,747
who else is closing some claims, you know, and and they, and they just said, you need to
stop worrying about it.

20
00:01:12,747 --> 00:01:13,887
You're in no danger.

21
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,550
for a new adjuster

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:26,980
They may not know the why at the time, if they really study your program and take that
stuff to heart and use it and literally follow it, just do it without knowing why you're

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,131
doing it and you'll know later on.

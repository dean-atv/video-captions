1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,961
it was fast.

2
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:05,897
didn't mean to go through it as quick as I did, but I finished one and I'm I want see what
this next one is.

3
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:08,770
it was really good it did what I want, what I needed it to do.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,699
I felt like there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle and I didn't know how, how they fit
together.

5
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:15,423
I got to see the box on the front of the puzzle cover

6
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:18,878
I always want to be as prepared as I possibly can be for what's coming.

7
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:20,917
And that makes me feel a whole lot better.

8
00:01:22,235 --> 00:00:27,284
I'd love to do this live but the recorded, I've gone back numerous times it's a lot of
information to take in.

9
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:32,437
And I realized that once I was kind of being tested on it, it was like, I need to go take
some of this back in again.

10
00:00:32,437 --> 00:00:34,468
So I think that's a real valuable asset to have.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,660
to schedule your first deployment.

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,584
Do this, do this, do this, it's just the steps.

13
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:48,590
all the little things that I see are going to help me build speed down the road, whether
it's scheduling, the macros, the templates, all that type of stuff that I could see could

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,474
really start cutting a lot of time so you can push a lot more claims out.

15
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:59,183
when I laid out that credit card, was like, that was a lot of money I just spent right
there, but I have no regrets whatsoever.

16
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:04,410
fast track stuff plus the Xactimate level one and two trainings, all that combined.

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,571
I feel I got a good bargain.

18
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:08,241
absolutely, yeah, yeah, no hesitation.
